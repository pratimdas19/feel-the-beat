# 🎵 FEEL THE BEATS

**Feel The Beats** is a small personal project where I explored how AI, mood interpretation, and music platform APIs can blend together to create a personalised music experience.  
It generates a **40-song playlist** purely from a mood you type in — and builds that playlist directly inside Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube Music.

## ✨ Why I Built This
I wanted to combine two things I love:  
- **Understanding vibes, moods, colours, emotions**  
- **Building interactive, functional tools with code and APIs**

This project sits somewhere between creativity and engineering.  
Not a full product — just something I built for myself to learn, improve, and experiment.

## 🎧 What It Does
- Takes a mood input (e.g., *soft haze*, *angry gym mode*, *rainy nostalgia*)  
- Uses AI to translate the mood into genres, keywords, energies, and aesthetic cues  
- Curates a **40-song playlist** across platforms  
- Creates the playlist directly inside the user’s chosen streaming app  
- Generates **custom playlist cover art** based on the vibe  
- Presents everything through a clean, bold, neon-inspired UI

## 🛠️ Tech & Concepts I Worked With
- **AI prompt engineering** for mood → music mapping  
- **Frontend design** with strong focus on simplicity and vibe consistency  
- **API integrations**  
  - Spotify Web API  
  - Apple Music (MusicKit)  
  - YouTube Music via YouTube Data API  
- **OAuth authentication** for all platforms  
- **Dynamic playlist cover art generation**  
- **Interactive UI transitions** and glow effects  
- **Stable design system** using colour psychology and mood-driven palettes

## ⚙️ How It Works (High-Level)
1. User enters a mood  
2. AI interprets the mood and builds a music profile  
3. System finds tracks that match the profile across the selected platform  
4. Playlist of 40 songs is generated  
5. After login, the playlist is created directly inside the selected music app  
6. AI generates a custom cover based on the vibe  
7. User sees the playlist + cover in a clean preview before opening it
