# Feel The Beats

**Feel The Beats** is a personal project where I explored how AI, mood detection, and music platform APIs can work together to create a unique playlist experience.  
The tool generates a **40-song playlist** based entirely on the user’s mood input and can create the playlist directly inside Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube Music.

## 🎧 What It Does
- Takes a mood or emotional prompt from the user  
- Uses AI to interpret the vibe and match it with relevant genres, moods, and keywords  
- Generates a curated 40-song playlist  
- Creates the playlist inside the user’s chosen streaming platform  
- Produces dynamic playlist cover art based on the user’s mood

## 🛠️ What I Used / Built
- **AI prompt engineering** for mood-to-music mapping  
- **Frontend UI**: clean, minimal, mood-centric interface  
- **API Integrations**:  
  - Spotify Web API  
  - Apple Music (MusicKit)  
  - YouTube Music via YouTube Data API  
- **OAuth login flow** for each music platform  
- **Vibe-based playlist cover generation** using image generation models  
- **Neon-inspired design system** to reflect changing moods  
- **Dynamic interactions** for input, transitions, and playlist previews

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a mood (e.g., *calm rainy evening*, *chaotic energy*)  
2. AI converts that mood into genres, tempo ranges, and song descriptors  
3. The system searches each platform for matching tracks  
4. A playlist of 40 songs is generated  
5. After login, the playlist is created directly in the user’s streaming app  
6. A custom playlist cover is generated to match the mood
